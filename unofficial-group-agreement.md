Due to members that have less understanding or completely no understanding in betting, I'm aware that posting unofficial picks is not a good idea, hence, I am going to post future unofficial picks in another isolated group, where member has to agree on this before being accepted.

# Agreement on joining unofficial picks channel
1. You completely understand the risk of betting and gambling
2. You understand you have been warned that you CAN lose your money
3. You are not mentally sick
4. You agree that unofficial pick are my personal bets that isn't meant to be part of services
5. NO bitching if you lost money, you've been warned.


If you agree on everything above, you can join the unofficial picks channel. If you joined meaning that you agreed.
