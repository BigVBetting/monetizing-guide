## Betting Philosophy
As a gamblers with years of experience in betting, I figured that to really make a profit in long term, some principle has to be followed.<br />
There's a few things you need to understand, if one claims to be able to *double your bankroll* in a few days, it also indicates he can halve your bankroll in few days as well.<br />
Futhermore instead of betting on low odds bets (already indicate higher chance), I will bet on something close to an average odds of 2.
By doing so I'll probably have *Lower win rates*, but you need 4 wins to cover one loss in those groups, but here, it's just one.
If you learnt advanced statistics, you'll know that's just ridiculous.

## Past Performance
I'll separate my picks and my bankroll in different spreadsheet, as it's easier for me.

## Bankroll Management
- *1 Unit* 	- This means 1%~2% of your bankroll.

You can define either 1 Unit to be 1% or 2% of your bankroll, basically higher percentage is more aggressive, lower is more conservative. Personally, I define 1 Unit as 1% of my bankroll.

### What's bankroll??
Bankroll basically means the money you initially have for betting, which is set apart just for betting.
I update my bankroll *once a week*, it's suggested to update your bankroll once a week/month for compouding benefits.
