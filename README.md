## Betting Philosophy
As a gamblers with years of experience in betting, I figured that to really make a profit in long term, some principle has to be followed. There's a few things you need to understand, if one claims to be able to *double your bankroll* in a few days, it also indicates he can halve your bankroll in few days as well. **Futhermore instead of betting on low odds bets (already indicate higher chance), I will bet on something close to an average odds of 2.** By doing so I'll probably have *Lower win rates*, but you need 4 wins to cover one loss in those groups, but here, it's just one. If you learnt advanced statistics, you'll know that's just ridiculous.

### Point proof: Why high win rates on low odds bet is stupid.
Assume you have $1, and you wanted to double it, let's see if you play a dice with 50% win rate and 90% win rate.
*There's no house edge, fees, in this demostration. Easier to show you the idea.*
> To double $1 to $2, you just need to win once in a game with odds of 2.0(50%), probabilities to win = (0.5)^1 = 50% , to lose = 100%-50% = 50%

> To double $1 to $2, you need 8 win continuously in games with odds of 1.1(90%), probabilities to win = (0.90)^8 = 43%, to lose = 100%-43% = 64%

**I think now you won't be fooled by "Win rate 80%" anymore. FYI, most professional poker/bettor only seek of 52.4%+ win rates.**

## Past Performance
I'll separate my picks and my bankroll in different spreadsheet, as it's easier for me.

## Bankroll Management
- *1 Unit* 	- This means 1%~2% of your bankroll.

You can define either 1 Unit to be 1% or 2% of your bankroll, basically higher percentage is more aggressive, lower is more conservative. Personally, I define 1 Unit as 1% of my bankroll.

### What's bankroll??
Bankroll basically means the money you initially have for betting, which is set apart just for betting.
I update my bankroll *once a week*, it's suggested to update your bankroll once a week/month for compouding benefits.
