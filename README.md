## Betting Philosophy
Consistenty is the key, never get caught by your emotion, remember, losing and winning is just a swings, it's not realized until you stop. Always follow your betting strategy, stake carefully, NEVER chase your losses.

## Staking Strategy (How much should I bet?)
- *1 Unit* 	- This means a decided % of your Bankroll
In the group I'll use 2.5% as each unit, so when I bet 1 unit, I bet 2.5% of my Bankroll.

### Fixed Staking
This is the most simple way and it works. Decide an amount for each unit, say $5, so you'll always bet $5 when the tips say 1 unit.

### Propotinal Staking (Dynamic Staing)
This might be a little bit complicated, but basically, you decide a % instead of a fixed amount, say 1 unit as 2.5%, you bet 2.5% of BR whenever the tips suggested to bet 1unit.
(Remember you should not change the staking unit too frequently, I suggest re-calculate each unit once a week, not daily.)

## Resources
You joined a betting group that gives you analyzed picks to bet on, that boost your winning chances. Thus we don't serve as a betting boot camp that teach you how to bet, however I'm kind and helpful so I made this whole guide. xD
