**Looking for investor fundings for group**
I believe most bettor missed our NBA tipsters, but it's sad that we've already paid for NHL tipsters, where the group revenue haven't covered the cost yet.
Some may ask, why do I picked NHL tipster? First of all, he give tips earlier, and it's profitable too. Just not that great as NBA, consider there's a lot of half win and pushes in NHL.

But still, people wanted NBA tipster, and one members from this group has already interested in investing.
This is an investment, so you're expect to be benefits from it too, how?

Investor Benefits
1. You get the NBA tips back into our group.
2. Your *might* be granted extra subscription time once we're able to balance the cost.

*How much funding are we looking for?*
I don't like to disclose the revenue, but I had to be transparent to investor.
This month, we paid $600 to the NHL tipster, and the subscription revenue is only $474.53 now.
That means we're short $125.47, but that's okay, I've got it covered with my own profit from betting.

The cost for the NBA tipster is $800 a month, the idea is, the investor will be sharing this cost together,
for the first month, and for next month (Feb), if the subscription revenue is able to cover the cost,
we'll then hire solely NBA tipster alone, until we're able to afford both.
If the subscription revenue is still same or not showing growth, we would then evaluate if the NBA tipster is worth to continue investing.


*Here's the stats of the NBA tips*
The first tips started on Dec 28, till today, the P/L is 17unit.
Which means if you bet $10 as a unit, this will be profit of $170 in 10 days,
If you bet $26 as a unit, like me, that'll be profit of $442.

So if you're unit size is larger or equal to me, this investment doesn't sounds so bad at all.
One of the interested investor in this group is betting $260 per unit, that automatically translate into a profit of $4,420.
